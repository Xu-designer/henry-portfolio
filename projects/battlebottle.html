                <p>
                    For this assignment in DES 014, we were to reinvent a paper sculpture of our choice into a design object, and represent it on a 11x14 sheet of paper. We were also to inspire the design after an illustrator's style of our choice, based on the research done in a previous assignment.
                </p>

                <h2>PAPER SCULPTURE</h2>

                    <img src="../images/battlebottle_papersculpture.jpg" alt="paper sculpture of my choice">

                    <p>
                        The image above shows the paper sculpture I chose. With its long, twisting form and pointed end, this sculpture reminded me of the bullet-shaped bottle my family had gotten recently from a military attraction. This served as the inspiration for what was to be the Battle Bottle.
                    </p>

                <h2>ILLUSTRATOR INSPIRATION</h2>

                    <img src="../images/study_a_designer.jpg" alt="study of Ken Sugimori">

                    <p>
                        The designer I ended up taking inspiration from for this project was Ken Sugimori, a major designer and illustrator for Pokemon and other works. His early illustratons used a watercolor style with high contrast lighting, which matched well with my own intention to use watercolor. 
                    </p>

                <h2>INITIAL IDEATION</h2>

                    <img src="../images/battlebottle_whiteboard.jpg" alt="whiteboard sketch">

                    <p>This is the first iteration of my design, which I ended up changing a lot. This version doesn't put as much focus on the bottle itself, and the figure is facing away from the front. I decided for my final design, it needed to put central focus on the design object.</p>

                <h2>SKETCH</h2>

                    <p>
                        These following images show the sketches that would lead to my final design. First I made a digital sketch, which I then translated to paper.

                    <div class="photogrid">

                    </div>    

                    <p>
                        Finally, I incorporated watercolors, completing the final design:
